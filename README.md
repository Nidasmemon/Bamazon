# Bamazon

This is a CLI based application where the user is either the 'Customer' or 'Manager'. As a customer, as soon as the application is executed, all the items available for sale are rendered as a table for the customer to view. The customer is then prompted with two messages: the first asks them what product they would like to purchase, and the second asks how many units they would like. If there is not enough in the stock, the purchase does not go through and the customer is given a message stating so. If there is enough in the stock, then the order is processed and the customer is shown the total amount due.

As a manager, the application prompts the user with four different options: the first is they can view the products for sale, the second shows the products with low inventory, the third lets the manager update the inventory, and the last option allows them to add a new product to the store.
